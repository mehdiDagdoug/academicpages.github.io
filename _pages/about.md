Short bio
======

Since 2019, I am a PhD student at the Université de Bourgogne Franche-Comté, working under the supervision of the professors Camelia Goga and David Haziza. My research interests include the theory of survey sampling, missing data, statistical learning and matrix completion. More precisely, I am working on solving estimation problems in survey sampling, with possible nonresponse, using matrix completion algorithms and statistical learning predictive models. I am also a teaching assistant at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté for classes in Bachelor and Master degrees.
